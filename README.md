# ED - Keep track of Github Milestones

[A while ago Github heavily improved their issue interface](https://github.com/blog/1866-the-new-github-issues). Milestones also got some love, but still feel clunky. For instance, you can only see the number of open and closed issues, but not the issues that people currently work on. If you want to be informed about the daily progress it's important to know this. 



At MPS we use Github's Milestone to group and organize our 


- Prefix Everthing! 
 - Milestone/Branches + Issues with numbers
 - Milestone/Branches with type (fix/milestone/hotfix/refactor)
